# Telegrambot
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/T-Eberle/tgbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/T-Eberle/tgbot)

Welcome to a UWSGI based abstract Telegram Bot. With this framework you are easily able to set up a complete Telegram Bot with self made commands without a lot of extra work. All abstract commands are implemented as GET-Responses as explained on https://core.telegram.org/bots/api. This means you don't need to have experience in http requests or php: All you need is python.

In the next few chapters I will explain you all the Features and how to properly set up the bot.
